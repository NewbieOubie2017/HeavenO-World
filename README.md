Learning exercise for open source contributions
Plants and being outdoors are my first choice but i like variety.
Perhaps i can make some contributions to libre office like default save name being the first phrase of a document. Probably years away from doing something as complex as that now that I know more about how little I know.  I tried to add to Nemo the file search engine for Linux mint 18 & 19 and whew!  What an amazing program that I now appreciate more.
